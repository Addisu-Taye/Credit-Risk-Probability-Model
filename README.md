# Credit Risk Probability Model

This project implements an end-to-end credit risk scoring model using alternative data sources. It transforms behavioral data into predictive risk signals to enable buy-now-pay-later services.

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### Basel II Accord Influence on Model Requirements
The Basel II Capital Accord emphasizes the importance of accurate risk measurement and capital adequacy. This influences our model requirements in several ways:

1. **Interpretability**: Financial institutions must be able to explain their credit decisions, especially when rejecting applicants. This pushes us toward models that balance performance with interpretability.

2. **Documentation**: The Basel framework requires thorough documentation of risk assessment processes, driving our focus on reproducible pipelines and experiment tracking.

3. **Risk Sensitivity**: The accord requires capital reserves to reflect actual risk levels, necessitating models that provide accurate probability estimates rather than just classifications.

### Proxy Variable Creation Necessity

Since we lack direct default information, creating a proxy variable is necessary because:

1. We need a target variable to supervise our machine learning model training
2. Real default data would require waiting for loan outcomes over time
3. Historical transaction patterns can serve as a reasonable proxy for future creditworthiness

Potential business risks of using this proxy include:

1. **Misclassification**: Customers might be incorrectly labeled as high/low risk
2. **Bias**: The proxy might capture behaviors not truly indicative of creditworthiness
3. **Regulatory challenges**: Proxies may not meet regulatory definitions of credit risk
4. **Performance drift**: Behavioral patterns may change over time reducing proxy validity

### Trade-offs: Simple vs Complex Models

| Consideration              | Simple Models (Logistic Regression/WoE) | Complex Models (Gradient Boosting) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Interpretability          | High - easy to explain                   | Low - "black box" nature           |
| Regulatory Compliance     | Easier to satisfy                        | More challenging                   |
| Performance               | Good baseline                            | Generally better                   |
| Development Time          | Faster                                   | Longer                             |
| Monitoring Requirements   | Less intensive                           | More intensive                     |
| Feature Engineering Needs | Requires manual selection                | Can handle more features automatically |
| Stability                 | More stable                              | Potential for overfitting          |
